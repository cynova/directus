# REST API

<div class="two-up">
<div class="left">

> The Directus dynamic REST API includes a comprehensive set of endpoints that covers every feature of the platform. Along with the GraphQL API, it is the primary way to interact with the content of your database.

::: tip API Authentication

To access any of these REST API endpoints, you'll first need to [authenticate](/reference/api/authentication/) or request data that has been set to [public](/guides/permissions/#configuring-public-permissions).

:::

::: tip Items Endpoint

Chances are you're looking for how to interact with **Items**, the atomic content unit within Directus. If so, please jump ahead to the [Items Endpoint](/reference/api/rest/items/) section of the API Reference.
